# POST-INVERSION CONSTRAINTS --------
# Post-inversion constraints are applied AFTER the inversion process,
# on a per-station basis. They help filter out unreliable or physically
# implausible solutions without overly constraining the inversion itself.
#
# Rationale:
# - Inversion often benefits from being more permissive during fitting.
# - Instead of forcing strict bounds during the inversion (which can
#   prevent convergence), it can be more effective to reject "bad"
#   solutions afterwards using post-inversion checks.

#       Er_freq_range = noise, noise
#   Use the whole spectrum:
#       Er_freq_range = None
#           or
#       Er_freq_range = None, None
#   Use the lowest possible frequency, and set the max frequency

#       Er_freq_range = None, noise
#   Use frequencies between 1 and 10 Hz
#       Er_freq_range = 1, 10
#   Use frequencies between 1 and the "noise limit"
#       Er_freq_range = 1, noise

# IQR is the interquartile range Q3-Q1, where Q1 is the 25% percentile
# and Q3 is the 75% percentile.
# Values that are smaller than (Q1 - nIQR*IQR) or larger than (Q3 + nIQR*IQR)
