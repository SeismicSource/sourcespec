Make sure to read the detailed Changelog below 👇

### v1.8: Input/output

- Introducing a new file format for providing event information
  (hypocentral location, magnitude, focal mechanism, moment tensor):
  the [SourceSpec Event File].
- New HDF5 and TEXT file formats to store spectra
- Station residuals are now saved in an HDF5 spectrum file, instead of a
  pickle file
- New config file option `save_spectra` to save the spectra to an HDF5 file
  in the output directory
- Changes in the YAML output file:
  - `bsd` (Brune stress drop) parameter renamed to `ssd` (static stress drop)
  - Store in the `event_info` section the values of vp, vs and rho close to
    the hypocenter
  - Store in the `inversion_info` section the type of wave used for the
    inversion (P, S, SV or SH)
- Changes in the SQLite database (warning: these changes break compatibility
  with previous database versions):
  - `bsd` (Brune stress drop) parameter renamed to `ssd` (static stress drop)
  - Store the `Stations` table information on whether each parameter is an
    outlier (see [#38])
  - Make place in the `Stations` table for station-level errors on radiated
    energy (even if they are currently not computed)
  - Store in the `Events` table the number of observations used for computing
    each summary parameter
  - Store in the `Events` table weighted means for radiated energy and local
    magnitude, even if those means are currently the same as the simple means,
    since those parameters do not have station-level errors defined
  - New columns for apparent stress in both `Events` and `Stations` tables
  - Store in the `Events` table the values of vp, vs and rho close to the
    hypocenter
  - Store in the `Events` table the type of wave used for the inversion
    (P, S, SV or SH)
- New command line option (`-u` or `--updatedb`) to update an existing database
  from a previous version
- Input files are now linked symbolically in the `input_files` subdirectory
  of the output directory (not implemented for Windows)

  - Author, agency and run completion date in the summary table
  - SourceSpec version in the inversion information table
  - Link to input files
  - Information on the type of wave used for the inversion (P, S, SV or SH)

### v1.8: Processing

- Use all the available components to compute P-wave spectra (previously,
  only the vertical component was used)
- Possibility of specifying a free surface amplification factor different
  from 2
- Possibility of specifying a layered velocity and density model for the
  source
- Possibility of specifying a different density for the source and for the
  stations
- If density is not provided (i.e., it is `None`), use the density from the
  global velocity model "iasp91"
- Teleseismic geometrical spreading model (Okal, 1992)
- New weighting option based on inverse frequency, so that lower frequencies
  have larger weight in the inversion. If traces contain noise, weights will
  be set to zero where SNR < 3 (see [#37])
- For weights computed from spectral S/N ratio (noise weighting), set to zero
  all the weights below 20% of the maximum weight, so that these weakly
  constrained parts of the spectrum are ignored in the inversion
- Possibility of using variable signal window lengths for each station
  as a function of the travel time of the P or S wave (see [#48])

### v1.8: Inversion

- Possibility of using the magnitude (or scalar moment) provided in the event
  file as initial Mw value for the inversion
- Reintroduced the possibility of providing the variability around the initial
  Mw value
- By combining the previous options, it is now possible to fix the Mw value
  during the inversion to the value provided in the event file

### v1.8: Post-Inversion

- Possibility of choosing the "k" coefficient to compute source radius from
  corner frequency (Kaneko and Shearer, 2014)
- Better control on the frequency range used for computing radiated energy
  (see [#49])
- Use station-specific radiation pattern (when available) for computing
  radiated energy
- Take into account for energy partition when computing radiated energy
  (Boatwright and Choy, 1986). This affects mostly the radiated energy
  computed from P waves
- New source parameter: apparent stress
- For parameters with no station-level uncertainty defined (currently,
  radiated energy and local magnitude), use simple mean when computing summary
  weighted averages (the previous behavior was to not compute weighted averages
  for these parameters)

### v1.8: Plotting

- Show the station radiated energy (Er) value on the station spectra plots
- Show the summary radiated energy (Er) value on the stacked spectra plot
- Station maps improvements:
  - Possibility of choosing a basemap style or no basemap
  - Possibility of not plotting the coastlines

  - Improved computation of bounding box for regional and teleseismic events
  - Use a global orthographic projection when using stations at large
    teleseismic epicentral distances (more than 3000 km)
- Changes to `plot_sourcepars`:
  - Read vp, vs and rho from the SQLite database (previously: vs was hardcoded
    to 3.5 km/s, rho to 2700 kg/m3 and vp was not used)
  - Read the source radius "k" coefficient from the SQLite database
    (previously: "k" was hardcoded to 0.3724, value for the Brune model)
  - New command line option `--wave_type` to select the wave type (P, S, SV
    or SH) for plots involving the corner frequency
  - Possibility of plotting histogram of apparent stress
  - Option to filter events by apparent stress

### v1.8: Config file

  more ranges of epicentral distances. It replaces the old parameter
  `max_epi_dist`.

  amplification factor (default: 2)
- New config parameter `layer_top_depths` to specify the depth of the top of
  the layers in a layered velocity and density model
- The config parameters `vp_source`, `vs_source` and `rho_source` can now be
  lists of values, to specify a layered velocity and density model for the
  source
- Config parameter `rho` renamed to `rho_source`
- New config parameter `rho_stations`
- New config parameter `geom_spread_min_teleseismic_distance` to set the
  minimum epicentral distance for using the teleseismic geometrical
  spreading model
- New config parameters `kp` and `ks` to set the "k" coefficient for
  computing source radius from corner frequency
- Config parameter `pi_bsd_min_max` renamed to `pi_ssd_min_max`
- New option `inv_frequency` for the config parameter `weighting` (see [#37])
- Config parameter `max_freq_Er` replaced by `Er_freq_range` (see [#49])
- New parameters, `qml_event_description` and `qml_event_description_regex`,
  to obtain the event name from the QuakeML event "description" tag
- New parameter `Mw_0_from_event_file` to use the magnitude (or scalar moment)
  provided in the event file as initial Mw value for the inversion
- Reintroduced the parameter `Mw_0_variability` to set the variability around
  the initial Mw value
- New parameter `plot_save_asap` to save plots as soon as they are ready.
  This uses less memory but slows down the code.
- New parameter `plot_map_style` to choose the map style
- New parameter `plot_map_api_key` to provide a Stadia Maps
  api key for Stamen Terrain basemap
- New option for the parameter `plot_coastline_resolution`: `no_coastline`
- New config parameter `variable_win_length_factor` to specify window
  length as a fraction of the travel time of the P/S wave (see [#48])

### v1.8: Bugfixes

- Fix source radius computation when using P waves (use P-wave velocity instead
  of S-wave velocity)
- Do not ignore picks labeled with lowercase "p" or "s"
- Fixed: config parameter `p_arrival_tolerance` was used also for S waves,
  instead of `s_arrival_tolerance` (see [#35])
- Fix Boatwright spreading model (log10 instead of natural log)
- Fix bug where signal and noise windows were plotted with the wrong length,
  under certain circumstances (see [#35])
- Fixes related to records with short signal windows (see [#39])
- Fix for beachball not plotted anymore with recent versions of Matplotlib.
- Fix bug where traces ignored because of low spectral S/N ratio, where still
  plotted as if they were valid traces
- Fix bug when specifying an absolute path for output directory: the path
  was treated as relative (see [#40])
- Fix bug where paths starting with tilde (~) were not parsed correctly
  (see [#43] and [#44])

- Matplotlib minimum version raised to 3.2
- Cartopy minimum version raised to 0.21

## v1.7 - 2023-03-31

This release improves trace processing through the use of modern routines for
instrument correction, optional baseline removal, a new clipping detection
algorithm and a better definition of signal and noise time windows.

A new plot is introduced, "stacked spectra" which allows to compare all the
spectra at once (and easily detect problematic stations 😉).
Also, a new command line tool, `plot_sourcepars`, allows making aggregate
plots of source parameters for many events (starting from the SQLite database).

New config file parameters have been added, while some have been removed.
Please run `source_spec -U CONFIG_FILE_NAME` to update your old config file.

As always, many bugfixes and improvements have been made in this release.
Thanks to all the users who took time to write and ask questions (by mail
or using the official SourceSpec [Discussions]).

Big kudos to Kris Vanneste [@krisvanneste] who helped all along the development
with code review and testing and submitted pull requests on noise windows and
clipping detection.

Below is the detailed Changelog 👇

### v1.7: Input/output

- Possibility of using a single PAZ file as a "generic" PAZ file for all the
  stations
- Command line option `--station_metadata` (or `-w`) for overriding the config
  file parameter with the same name (see pull request [#16])
- Removed command line option `--no-response` for avoiding removing instrument
  response (use the config option `correct_instrumental_response` instead)
- New output file in YAML format. The old `.out` file is still available but
  deprecated.
- Information on the inversion procedure in YAML and HTML output
- Option to add an agency logo to the HTML page
- Possibility of generating HTML report without figures (see [#30])

### v1.7: Processing

- Use modern ObsPy `trace.remove_response()` routine for instrument correction
  (see [#27])
- Option to remove the trace baseline after instrument correction and before
  filtering (`remove_baseline` config parameter) (see [#25])
- New algorithms for clipping detection based on kernel density estimation of
  the trace amplitude values (see [#23], [#24], [#25])
  - Two methods are available:
    - `clipping_score`: compute a trace clipping score based on the shape of
      the kernel density estimation.
    - `clipping_peaks`: check if trace is clipped, based on the number of peaks
      in the kernel density estimation;
  - Use `clipping_detection_algorithm` in the config file to choose the
    algorithm and the other `clipping_*` parameters to adjust the results.
  - The algorithms can also be called from the command line, e.g. for debug
    purposes, using the shell command `clipping_detection`.
- Relax noise window requirements if noise weighting is not used.
  This is useful for older triggered records with noise windows
  that are short or even missing entirely (see pull request [#18])
- Some small improvements were made in the window definitions
  (see pull request [#18]):
  - Generate error if signal window is incomplete (P- or S-arrival
    before the start time of the trace)
  - Warn if noise window overlaps with P-window (instead of S-window, as in
    previous versions)
  - Constrain `signal_pre_time` for S-phase to half the S-P interval, if this
    interval is shorter than `signal_pre_time` (i.e., for short-distance
    records with short S-P interval)
- Extract source and station P and S velocities from global 'iasp91' velocity
  model, if both `v(p,s)_source` and `v(p,s)_stations` are set to `None`
  (see [#20])
- Magnitude limits for inversion are now autoset between 90% of the minimum
  of the spectral plateau and 110% of its maximum (see [#22])

### v1.7: Post-Inversion

- Possibility of choosing the reference summary statistics that will be used
  for map plots, QuakeML and HYPO output, as well as for the "Event Summary"
  section in HTML report and for computing station spectral residuals.
  Available summary statistics are:
  - mean
  - weighted_mean
  - percentiles (new!)
- Possibility of defining the number of sigmas for uncertainties on event means
  and weighted means

### v1.7: Plotting

- New plot: stacked spectra
- Do not zero-pad traces to common length when plotting, so that missing data
  at beginning or at the end can be easily detected (see [#21])
- Plot noise and signal windows separately for each component (see [#21])
- Show on the trace plot the reason why a trace has been ignored
- Logscale for boxplots, if parameters span a large interval
  (see pull request [#15])
- Support for SVG format for plot files (can be used in HTML output as
  alternative to PNG)
- Improved trace plot quality for vector formats (PDF, SVG)
- New command line tool: `plot_sourcepars` to make 1D or 2D plot of source
  parameters from a sqlite parameter file.

- New config parameter: `n_sigma`
- New config parameters for percentiles calculation: `lower_percentage`,
  `mid_percentage` and `upper_percentage`

  signals:
  - `bp_freqmin_disp`, `bp_freqmax_disp`
  - `freq1_disp`, `freq2_disp`
- Default values for `t_star_min_max` (instead of `None`)

### v1.7: Code improvements

- Large refactoring of the whole codebase, to make the code more modern and
  easier to maintain (see [#28])

### v1.7: Bugfixes

- Properly ignore vertical components when `ignore_vertical` is `True`
- Fix a bug preventing reading phase picks from HYPOINVERSE-2000 files

    calculation and spectral analysis
  - the old parameters, `noise_win_length` and `s_win_length`, are no more
    supported and generate an error
- Reorganized config file and improved inline documentation within the file
  - removed unused option: `fc_0`
  - removed `pre_filt` option
  - post-processing check on `fc` bounds has been removed
- Option to specify non standard instrument codes (e.g., `L` for
  acceleration)
- Option to specify filter frequencies for local magnitude computation
- Plotting improvements:
  - Show S/N ratio on trace plots
  - Show spectral S/N ratio on spectrum plots
  - Option to show/hide ignored traces/spectra (low S/N)
- Bug fixes:
  - Pay attention to location code when building average spectra
  - Plotting: avoid overlapping traces with different location code
  - Plotting: avoid overlapping spectra with different location code

## v0.9 - 2020-04-24

- Support for QuakeML input and StationXML
- Support for Python 3.5
- Only compatible with ObsPy >= 1.1.0
- Project reorganization:
  - Project renamed to SourceSpec
  - `ssp_residuals` renamed to `source_residuals`
  - New installable package (e.g., via `pip`)
- Spectra are smoothed in log-freq (no more Konno-Ohmachi)
- Inversion is performed in a log-freq space
- Option to invert for `t_star_0` on the plateau level
- Traces are filtered before computing S/N ratio
- Trace clipping detection
- Traces are always plotted, even if no inversion is performed
- Use by default a global model for theoretical travel time calculation
- Possibility of using NonLinLoc travel time grids (requires `nllgrid`)
- New options for P and S arrival time tolerance
- New option for maximum epicentral distance for trace processing
- Possibility of using a NonLinLoc model grid for obtaining vs at the source
  and at the receiver (requires `nllgrid`)
- Use `log10` of weighting function, since the inversion is done in magnitude
  units
- Use `json` format for `traceid` correction file
- Save config file to output dir (only for `source_spec`)
- Save run completion time into output file
- Logarithmic average and logarithmic (asymmetric) error bars for Mo, fc and
  source radius
- Computation of radiated energy
- Station-specific filters
- New parameters: `gap_max`, `overlap_max`
- Add legend to spectral plots
- Add event information, code version and run completion time to plots
- Multifigure plotting for traces and spectra (for large number of stations)
- New option to plot a station map, color-coded by station magnitude
  (requires Cartopy)
- Refactoring of local magnitude computation code:
  - Wood-Anderson amplitude is computed from the whole trace converted to W-A
    and not converting only the min and max peaks (which is the default in
    ObsPy)
  - Trace windowing is computed on HF envelopes
  - New option for custom Ml coefficients
  - Remove unnecessary Ml options
- Code cleaning and optimization:
  - Switch from `optparse` (deprecated) to `argparse`
  - Code style fixes and refactoring
- New option to update a config file from previous versions
- BUGFIX: Fix a major bug in reading hypo pick file
- BUGFIX: Fix for pick file not read in `source_model`

## v0.8 - 2014-07-11

- Trace plot showing S and noise time windows

- Option to use bounded inversion
- Station residuals, through `ssp_residuals.py`
- `source_model` can now output tables of trade-off between parameters
- Fix in the way noise trace is computed and processed
- Documentation!

## v0.6 - 2013-06-05

- Signal to noise weighting
- Improved local magnitude computation
- New options:
  - time domain integration
  - vertical component
- Largely improved plotting function
- More data formats supported (Antilles, IPOC)
- `source_model`: a code for plotting theoretical spectra
- Code refactoring

## v0.5 - 2013-02-10
