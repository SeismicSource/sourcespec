# SourceSpec

Earthquake source parameters from P- or S-wave displacement spectra

(c) 2011-2022 Claudio Satriano <satriano@ipgp.fr>

## v1.6 - 2022-08-02

This release introduces several modifications to the config file.
You will need to upgrade your old config files manually or using
`source_spec -U CONFIG_FILE_NAME`.

This release requires at least Python 3.6.

A lot of effort has been devoted to improve the documentation.
Please check it out on
[https://sourcespec.readthedocs.io/](https://sourcespec.readthedocs.io/)

### Input/output

- QuakeML output (when using QuakeML input)
- Command line option `--run-id` to provide a string identifying the
  current run (see pull request [#6])
- Write SourceSpec version to parfile
- Write SourceSpec version and run complete time to SQLite file
- Write author and agency info (if specified) to output files, figures and
  HTML report
- HTML page for misfit plots (when using grid search or importance sampling)
- Station table in HTML report is now sortable (and its header remains fixed)!
- Reduce PNG figures file size, while improving their resolution 😃
- Removed option to read event information and traces from a pickle file
  (rarely used)

### Processing

- Support for P-wave spectral inversion (see pull request [#9])
- It is now possible to provide different vp and vs velocities, close to the
  source and close to the stations (see the new config options above and
  issue [#5])
- Possibility to choose a geometrical spreading model between
  (see issue [#8]):
  - rⁿ (default: n=1 – body waves)
  - Boatwright et al. (2002): "r" below a cutoff distance, frequency-dependent
    above the cutoff distance
- Use travel time to compute quality factor from t* (and viceversa)
  (see issue [#5])
- Compute travel time from pick and origin time, when possible
  (see issue [#10])
- Warn if noise window ends after P or S arrival

### Post-Inversion

- Subtract the integral of noise spectrum from the integral of signal spectrum
  when computing radiated energy, under the hypothesis that energy is additive
  and noise is stationary

### Config file

- Config parameter `paz` has been removed and merged into `station_metadata`
- Config parameters `vp` and `vs` have been renamed to `vp_source`
  and `vs_source` (see issue [#5])
- New, optional, config parameter `vp_stations` and `vs_stations`
- Config parameter `pre_p_time` and `pre_s_time` have been renamed to
  `noise_pre_time` and `signal_pre_time`, respectively (see pull request [#9])
- Config parameter `rps_from_focal_mechanism` renamed to
  `rp_from_focal_mechanism` (see pull request [#9])
- New config parameter: `geom_spread_model` (see issue [#8])
- Config parameters `PLOT_SHOW`, `PLOT_SAVE` and `PLOT_SAVE_FORMAT` are now
  lowercase (`plot_show`, `plot_save` and `plot_save_format`)
- New, optional, general config parameters for specyfing author and agency
  information. This information is written to output files and figures,
  if specified
- New config parameter, `event_url`, to link the event page from the HTML
  report
- Removed `DEBUG` config parameter
- Parameters from `GENERAL PARAMETERS` section reorganized into a new
  section called `TRACE AND METADATA PARAMETERS`
- Some parameters from `INVERSION PARAMETERS` moved into a new section
  called `SPECTRAL MODEL PARAMETERS`

### Bugfixes

- Fix for not working `weighting` options: `frequency` and `no_weight`
- Fix for negative weights occasionally generated by interpolation
- Fix bug when event coordinates are written into sqlite as binary blobs

## v1.5 - 2022-05-22

This is a pretty big release coming after several months of work on a large
dataset of more than 5000 events in Mayotte.

Please read through the changelog to discover all the improvements and new
features.

You will need to update your old config files via
`source_spec -U CONFIG_FILE_NAME`

Note that v1.5 is no more compatible with Python 2!

### v1.5: Input/output

- Write output files into a subdirectory of OUTDIR, whose name is
  the event id
- Support for HYPOINVERSE-2000 output files
- Removed autodetection of hypo71 file paths (specific to CRL case)
- SQLite output: added radiated energy, weighted averages,
  errors on parameters, number of observations, hypocentral location
  and origin time
- Removed `-C` argument to apply station correction to spectra. Now spectra
  are automatically corrected if `residuals_filepath` is specified in the
  configuration file
- Save an additional event parameter to output files: average quality factor
- Save additional station parameters to output files:
  source radius, Brune stress drop, source radius, quality factor
- Mark outliers in `.out` file and in html report
- Colored console output for log messages! (Not supported on Windows)

### v1.5: Processing

- New parameter for setting the width of the spectral smoothing window
  in terms of frequency decades: `spectral_smooth_width_decades`
  (see issue [#2])
- Compute spectral weights after spectral correction (when a station
  residuals file is specified via `residuals_filepath`)
- Removed configuration parameter `trace_format`
- New configuration parameter `sensitivity` to provide a constant sensor
  sensitivity (flat response curve), which ovverides any response curve
  provided in metadata
- New parameter for manually specifying trace units: `trace_units`
  (defaults to `auto`)
- New approach for trace clipping detection (requires just one configuration
  parameter, named `clip_max_percent`)
  - Check for trace clipping only in the processing window
  - Use histogram of samples to detect clipping
- Fix for wrong component used for 'SV' spectra (see issue [#3])

### v1.5: Inversion

- New config option: `Mw_0_variability`. Allowed variability around `Mw_0`
  during the main inversion. Previously hardcoded to 0.1
- New inversion methods for grid sampling:
  - grid search (very slow!)
  - importance sampling of the misfit grid using k-d tree
    (faster, but less accurate)
- Fix for Basin-hopping algorithm not running

### v1.5: Post-Inversion

- New set of post-inversion parameters to reject certain inversion results,
  per-station: `pi_fc_min_max`, `pi_t_star_min_max`, `pi_bsd_min_max`,
  `pi_misfit_max`
- Reject inversion results when inverted `fc` is within 10% of `fc_min` or
  `fc_max`
- Fix: use logarithmic error width for weighted logarithmic averages
  - previous way of computing weighted logarithmic averages was not correct!
- Option to reject outliers using the IQR (interquartile range) method:
  parameter `nIQR`
- Support for non symmetric error on station spectral parameters
- Compute additional, per-station parameters: source radius, Brune stress
  drop and quality factor
- Compute errors for all station parameters
- Compute weighted averages for all event parameters (except radiated energy)
- Compute spectral residuals using weighted average spectral parameters
- Plotting:
- Source parameter box plots to evaluate parameter dispersion across stations
  and visually detect outliers
- Misfit plot (2D and 1D) when using grid sampling
- `cartopy` removed as installation dependency, since it is not easily
  installable via `pip`
- Use GSHHS database to draw coastlines.
  - New config option: `plot_coastline_resolution`
- Correctly show circles on maps with diagonal smaller than 1 km
- Fix plotting map colorbar on Matplotlib 3.5
- Make average and errorbar lines more visible on map colorbar
- Fix for error on plotting fc map, when only one station is available
- Fix trace plot scaling for traces with larger signal outside the plot
  window
- Do not plot 'H' spectrum if there is only one instrument component
  (since it will coincide with the only component)
- Plot uncorrected spectrum when station correction is used

## v1.4 - 2021-10-13

- New config option `rps_from_focal_mechanism` to compute station-specific
  S-wave radiation pattern from focal mechanism, if a focal mechanism is
  available in the QuakeML file
- Plot the focal mechanism on maps, if it is available
- Change default inversion algorithm to TNC (truncated
  Newton algorithm)
- Config option `dataless` renamed to `station_metadata`
- Config option `traceids` renamed to `traceid_mapping_file`

  `ignore_traceids` and `use_traceids`, respectively
- Support for 2D NonLinLoc grids (via `nllgrid >= 1.4.1`)
- Possibility of using a generic `DEFAULT` NonLinLoc time grid
- Added `cartopy` as an installation dependency
- Fixed: `nllgrid` was always requested at runtime
- Fixed: gracefully handle the case when there is no internet connection and
  map tiles cannot be downloaded
- Fixed (Windows): suppress colored terminal output, which is not supported
- Fixed (Windows): it is now possible to relaunch the same run, without
  having to delete the output directory first
- Fixed (Windows): use same timezone names than Linux and macOS
