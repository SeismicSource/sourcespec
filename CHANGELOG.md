# SourceSpec Changelog

Earthquake source parameters from P- or S-wave displacement spectra

Copyright (c) 2011-2023 Claudio Satriano <satriano@ipgp.fr>

## unreleased

This release requires at least Python 3.7.

### Bugfixes

- Do not ignore picks labeled with lowercase "p" or "s"
- Fixed: config parameter `p_arrival_tolerance` was used also for S waves,
  instead of `s_arrival_tolerance` (see [#35])
- Fix bug where signal and noise windows where plotted with the wrong length,
  under certain circumstances (see [#35])
- Fix for beachball not plotted anymore with recent versions of Matplotlib.

### Requirements

- Python minimum version raised to 3.7
- Matplotlib minimum version raised to 3.2
- Cartopy minimum version raised to 0.21

## v1.7 - 2023-03-31

This release improves trace processing through the use of modern routines for
instrument correction, optional baseline removal, a new clipping detection
algorithm and a better definition of signal and noise time windows.

A new plot is introduced, "stacked spectra" which allows to compare all the
spectra at once (and easily detect problematic stations üòâ).
Also, a new command line tool, `plot_sourcepars`, allows making aggregate
plots of source parameters for many events (starting from the SQLite database).

New config file parameters have been added, while some have been removed.
Please run `source_spec -U CONFIG_FILE_NAME` to update your old config file.

As always, many bugfixes and improvements have been made in this release.
Thanks to all the users who took time to write and ask questions (by mail
or using the official SourceSpec [Discussions]).

Big kudos to Kris Vanneste [@krisvanneste] who helped all along the development
with code review and testing and submitted pull requests on noise windows and
clipping detection.

Below is the detailed Changelog üëá

### v1.7: Input/output

- Possibility of using a single PAZ file as a "generic" PAZ file for all the
  stations
- Command line option `--station_metadata` (or `-w`) for overriding the config
  file parameter with the same name (see pull request [#16])
- Removed command line option `--no-response` for avoiding removing instrument
  response (use the config option `correct_instrumental_response` instead)
- New output file in YAML format. The old `.out` file is still available but
  deprecated.
- Information on the inversion procedure in YAML and HTML output
- Option to add an agency logo to the HTML page
- Possibility of generating HTML report without figures (see [#30])

### v1.7: Processing

- Use modern ObsPy `trace.remove_response()` routine for instrument correction
  (see [#27])
- Option to remove the trace baseline after instrument correction and before
  filtering (`remove_baseline` config parameter) (see [#25])
- New algorithms for clipping detection based on kernel density estimation of
  the trace amplitude values (see [#23], [#24], [#25])
  - Two methods are available:
    - `clipping_score`: compute a trace clipping score based on the shape of
      the kernel density estimation.
    - `clipping_peaks`: check if trace is clipped, based on the number of peaks
      in the kernel density estimation;
  - Use `clipping_detection_algorithm` in the config file to choose the
    algorithm and the other `clipping_*` parameters to adjust the results.
  - The algorithms can also be called from the command line, e.g. for debug
    purposes, using the shell command `clipping_detection`.
- Relax noise window requirements if noise weighting is not used.
  This is useful for older triggered records with noise windows
  that are short or even missing entirely (see pull request [#18])
- Some small improvements were made in the window definitions
  (see pull request [#18]):
  - Generate error if signal window is incomplete (P- or S-arrival
    before the start time of the trace)
  - Warn if noise window overlaps with P-window (instead of S-window, as in
    previous versions)
  - Constrain `signal_pre_time` for S-phase to half the S-P interval, if this
    interval is shorter than `signal_pre_time` (i.e., for short-distance
    records with short S-P interval)
- Extract source and station P and S velocities from global 'iasp91' velocity
  model, if both `v(p,s)_source` and `v(p,s)_stations` are set to `None`
  (see [#20])
- Magnitude limits for inversion are now autoset between 90% of the minimum
  of the spectral plateau and 110% of its maximum (see [#22])

### v1.7: Post-Inversion

- Possibility of choosing the reference summary statistics that will be used
  for map plots, QuakeML and HYPO output, as well as for the "Event Summary"
  section in HTML report and for computing station spectral residuals.
  Available summary statistics are:
  - mean
  - weighted_mean
  - percentiles (new!)
- Possibility of defining the number of sigmas for uncertainties on event means
  and weighted means

### v1.7: Plotting

- New plot: stacked spectra
- Do not zero-pad traces to common length when plotting, so that missing data
  at beginning or at the end can be easily detected (see [#21])
- Plot noise and signal windows separately for each component (see [#21])
- Show on the trace plot the reason why a trace has been ignored
- Logscale for boxplots, if parameters span a large interval
  (see pull request [#15])
- Support for SVG format for plot files (can be used in HTML output as
  alternative to PNG)
- Improved trace plot quality for vector formats (PDF, SVG)
- New command line tool: `plot_sourcepars` to make 1D or 2D plot of source
  parameters from a sqlite parameter file.

  signals:
  - `bp_freqmin_disp`, `bp_freqmax_disp`
  - `freq1_disp`, `freq2_disp`
- Default values for `t_star_min_max` (instead of `None`)

### v1.7: Code improvements

- Large refactoring of the whole codebase, to make the code more modern and
  easier to maintain (see [#28])

### v1.7: Bugfixes

- Properly ignore vertical components when `ignore_vertical` is `True`
- Fix a bug preventing reading phase picks from HYPOINVERSE-2000 files
- Fix for noise window not showing up in PNG trace plots in some cases
