SourceSpec documentation
========================

SourceSpec is a collection of command line programs (written in Python) to
determine earthquake source parameters (seismic moment :math:`M_0`, corner
frequency :math:`f_c`) and the inelastic attenuation term (:math:`t^*`), from
the modeling of waveform displacement spectra.

Other parameters (source radius :math:`r_0`, stress drop :math:`\Delta \sigma`)
are computed from the inverted ones. The quality factor :math:`Q_0` is
determined from :math:`t^*`.

As a bonus, local magnitude :math:`M_l` is computed as well.

SourceSpec is composed of the following programs:

* ``source_spec``: inverts the P- or S-wave displacement spectra from station
  recordings of a single event.
* ``ssp_residuals``: computes station residuals from ``source_spec`` output.
* ``source_model``: direct spectral modelling.
