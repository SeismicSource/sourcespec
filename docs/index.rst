SourceSpec documentation
========================

Earthquake source parameters from P- or S-wave displacement spectra

:Release: |release|
:Date:    |today|

SourceSpec is a collection of command line tools to compute earthquake
source parameters (seismic moment, corner frequency, radiated energy,
source size, stress drop) from the inversion of P-wave and S-wave
displacement spectra recorded at one or more seismic stations.
SourceSpec also computes attenuation parameters (t-star, quality factor)
and, as a bonus, local magnitude.

See :cite:t:`Madariaga2011` for a primer on earthquake source parameters and
scaling laws.

Go to section :ref:`theoretical_background:Theoretical Background`
to get more information on how the code works.

SourceSpec is written in Python and requires a working Python
environment to run (see :ref:`installation:Installation`).
However, since SourceSpec is based on command line, you donâ€™t have to
know how to code in Python to use it.

The SourceSpec package is made of several command line tools:

-  ``source_spec``: Compute earthquake source parameters from the
   inversion of P- or S-wave spectra.
-  ``source_model``: Direct modelling of P- or S-wave spectra, based on
   user-defined earthquake source parameters.
-  ``source_residuals``: Compute station residuals from ``source_spec``
   output.
- ``clipping_detection``: Test the clipping detection algorithm.
- ``plot_sourcepars``: 1D or 2D plot of source parameters from a sqlite
  parameter file.
